### Quick overview about myself
Hi:wave:

My name is **Mirodil Kamilov** who currently studies at Inha University in Tashkent in my *third year*. I am really passionate about learning web development in general. However, I have been actively learning PHP lately. So, in this repo, you will see my skills and knowledge as a **PHP developer**.
